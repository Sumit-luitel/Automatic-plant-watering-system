# Automatic-plant-watering-system
This project uses an Raspberry pi to monitor soil moisture levels and control a water pump. It integrates with Blynk for remote monitoring and control, and uses a Flask web server to display images captured during pump activation. The system ensures optimal soil hydration and allows for both automatic and manual pump control.
